    <abstract>


<t>The Authenticated Received Chain (ARC) protocol creates a mechanism whereby a
series of handlers of an email message can conduct authentication of the email
message as it passes among them on the way to its destination, and create an
attached, authenticated record of the status
at each step along the handling path, for use by
the final recipient in making choices about the disposition of the message.
Changes in the message that might break existing authentication mechanisms
can be identified through the ARC Set of header fields.</t>

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

<t>Modern email authentication techniques such as the Sender Policy Framework
(SPF) <xref target="RFC7208"/> and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) <xref target="RFC6376"></xref> have become
common. However, their end-to-end utility is limited by the effects of
intermediaries along the transmission path, which either are not listed (for
SPF) or which break digital signatures (for DKIM).  These issues are described
in substantial detail in those protocols’ defining documents as well as in
<xref target="RFC6377"/> and <xref target="RFC7960"/>.</t>

<t>Technologies that build upon the use of SPF and DKIM can reduce the success of
fraudulent email campaigns.  To this end, Domain-based Mail Authentication,
Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) <xref target="RFC7489"/>, validates the domain of the
RFC5322.From header field.
However its use along email transmission paths that have independent
intermediaries, such as some forwarders and essentially all mailing list
services, produces false positive rejections that are problematic, both for the
message authors, the intermediary service(s), and for those they are 
interacting with.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC7960"/> documented the need for a mechanism which would survive legitimate
alteration of a message, in spite of breaking the associated SPF and DKIM
information so that the end receiver system(s) can avoid those false positive
rejections on delivery.
Authenticated Received Chain (ARC) builds upon DKIM mechanisms to provide a
sequence of signatures that provide a
view of the handling sequence for a message, especially the points where
alterations of the content might have occurred.
Equipped with this more complete
information, the recipient system(s) can make a more informed handling choice,
reducing or eliminating the rejections that would occur with the
use of DKIM and/or SPF alone.</t>

<section anchor="general-concepts" title="General Concepts">

<t>ARC provides a “chain of custody” for a message, allowing each entity that
handles the message to see what entities handled it before, and to see what the
authentication status of the message was at each step in the handling.  The
handling entity can then put its own entry into the chain of custody and then
relay the message to the next handler.</t>

<t>When the message reaches final delivery, the decision to accept and deliver the
message, or, alternatively, to reject, discard, or quarantine it, can take the
chain of custody into account, applying local policy in addition to policies
advertised by the (purported) sending domain.  Consider, for example, this
scenario:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>A sender from mysender.example posts a message to a mailing list hosted at
listmania.example;</t>
  <t>The mailing list modifies the message by prepending the list name to the
subject line, then sends it to the subscribers;</t>
  <t>One of the subscribers is alice@mail.service.example, which receives the
message from listmania.example.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Assuming the original message was DKIM-signed and mysender.example published
an SPF record, the handling by the mailing list will break the DKIM signature
because of the message modification, and the forwarding will cause the SPF check
to fail in the next step.  But listmania.example can add ARC headers to the
message to add itself to the document’s chain of custody.  When
mail.service.example sees the message, it can see that SPF and DKIM validation
fail, but it can also see that both of these succeeded when they were checked
by listmania.example, and can verify listmania’s assertion.</t>

<t>As part of its evaluation of the message for delivery, mail.service.example can
see that mysender.example publishes a DMARC policy asking that unauthenticated
messages be rejected.  But is can also see the assertion by listmania.example
that the message was correctly authenticated when the message arrived there,
and if it accepts that assertion, it
can accept the message for further processing, rather than reject it, 
based on the additional information that ARC has provided.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="differences-between-arc-and-dkim" title="Differences Between ARC and DKIM">

<t>In DKIM, every participating signing agent attaches a signature that is based
on some of the content of the message, local policy, and the domain name of
the signing agent’s Administrative Management Domain (ADMD).  Any verifier can
process such a signature; a verified signature means that the domain referenced
in the signature’s “d=” parameter has some responsibility for handling the
message.  An artifact of using digital signature technology for this means that
verification also ensures that the portion of the message that was “covered” by
the signature has not been altered since the signature was applied.  The
signatures themselves are generally independent of one another.</t>

<t>In contrast, a validated ARC Set conveys the following pieces of information:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>An assertion that, at the time that the intermediary ADMD processed the
message, the various assertions (such as SPF, DKIM-Signature(s) and/or ARC Chain) 
already attached to the message by other ADMDs were or were not valid;</t>
  <t>As with DKIM, an assertion that, for a validated ARC signature, the domain name
in the signature takes some responsibility for handling of the message and that
the covered content of the message is unchanged since that signature was applied;</t>
  <t>A further assertion that binds the ARC evaluation results into the 
ARC Chain sequence.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”,
“SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “NOT RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be
interpreted as described in BCP14 (<xref target="RFC2119"/><xref target="RFC8174"/>).</t>

<t>Because many of the core concepts and definitions are found in <xref target="RFC5598"/>,
readers should to be familiar with the contents of <xref target="RFC5598"/>, and in
particular, the potential roles of intermediaries in the delivery of email.</t>

<section anchor="protocol-elements" title="Protocol Elements and Features">

<t>As with other domain authentication technologies (such as SPF, DKIM, and
DMARC), ARC makes no claims about the contents of the email message it has
sealed. However, for a valid and passing ARC Chain, a Final Receiver is able to
ascertain:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>all (participating) domains that claim responsibility for handling (and
possibly modifying) the email message in transit;</t>
  <t>trace information, including:  <list style="symbols">
      <t>the <xref target="RFC7601"/> Authentication-Results each participating ADMD saw; and</t>
      <t>additional data needed to compile a DMARC report for the sending domain.</t>
    </list></t>
</list></t>

<t>Given this information, each receiver is able to make a more informed local
policy decision regarding message processing and, ultimately, delivery to the 
end user in spite of 
authentication failure(s) and to inform the message orgination system(s) through
the DMARC report(s).</t>

<t>Every participant in an ARC Chain, except for the originating sender and Final
Receiver, is both an ARC Validator (when receiving) and then an ARC Sealer
(when sending a message onward).</t>

<t><spanx style="emph">INFORMATIONAL</spanx>: It is important to understand that validating and then
immediately sealing a message leaves no room for message modification, and many
early implementations of ARC did not initially work because both operations
were performed in a single pass over the message.</t>

<t>The following protocol features are functional parts and design decisions
related the protocol that are not specific to either Validators or Sealers, but
ensure that the ARC Chain conveys this information to a Final Receiver.</t>

<section anchor="arc-set-defn" title="The “ARC Set” of Header Fields">

<t>Each “ARC Set” consists of the following three new header fields:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>ARC-Authentication-Results (referred to below as “AAR”): virtually identical
in syntax to an Authentication-Results field <xref target="RFC7601"/>, this field records
the results of all message authentication checks done by the recording ADMD at
the time the message arrived. Additional information is placed in this field 
compared to a standard Authentication-Results field in order to support a more
complete DMARC report;</t>
  <t>ARC-Message-Signature (referred to below as “AMS”): virtually identical in
syntax to DKIM-Signature, this field contains the signature about the message
header and body as they existed at the time of handling by the ADMD adding it
(including any modifications made by the sealing ADMD);
and</t>
  <t>ARC-Seal (referred to below as “AS”): highly similar in structure and format
to a DKIM-Signature, this field applies a digital signature that protects the
integrity of all three of these new fields when they are added by an ADMD, plus
all instances of these fields added by prior ADMDs.</t>
</list></t>

<t>An ARC participant always adds all of these header fields 
before relaying a message to the next handling agent <spanx style="emph">en route</spanx> to
its destination.  Moreover, they each have an
“instance number” that increases with each ARC Set in the handling chain so that
their original order can be preserved and the three related header fields can 
be processed as a set.</t>

<section anchor="instance-tags" title="Instance Tags">

<t>ARC includes an indicator in its header fields to show the order in which the
header fields comprising an ARC Chain were added, and the specific members of
each ARC Set.  This is known as the “instance”, and the indicator is an “i=” tag/value.
That is, the members of the first ARC Set affixed to a message will all include
“i=1”.  This is described in detail in section <xref target="i-defn"/>.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="cv-values" title="Chain Validation Status">

<t>ARC includes a mechanism which denotes the state of the ARC Chain at each
step.  The “chain validation status” (“cv” tag/value) is used to communicate the
current chain status within the ARC Chain and also
through Authentication-Results and ARC-Authentication-Results
stamps as well as DMARC reporting.</t>

<t>The chain validation status has one of three possible values:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>none: There was no chain on the message when it arrived for validation; 
typically occurs when the message arrives at a Message Transfer Agent (MTA)
or mediator from a Message Submission Agent (MSA) or when any upstream handlers 
may not be participating in ARC handling;</t>
  <t>fail: The message has a chain whose validation failed;</t>
  <t>pass: The message has a chain whose validation succeeded.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="trace-information" title="Trace Information">

<t>ARC includes trace information encoded in the AAR. While section <xref target="aar-defn"/>
defines what information must be provided, sealing ADMDs may provide additional
information, and validating receivers may use this trace information
as they find it useful.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="key-mgmt" title="Key Management">

<t>The public keys for ARC header fields follow the same requirements, syntax and
semantics as those for DKIM signatures, described in Section 3.6 of
<xref target="RFC6376"/>.  ARC places no requirements on the selectors and/or domains used
for the ARC header field signatures.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="all-failures-are-permanent" title="All Failures are Permanent">

<t>Because ARC Chains are transmitted across multiple intermediaries, all errors,
even temporary ones, become unrecoverable and are considered permanent.</t>

<t>Any error validating or sealing a chain, for whatever reason, MUST result in a
“cv=fail” verdict as documented in <xref target="cv-defn"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="chain-of-custody" title="Chain of Custody">

<t>At a high level, an ARC Chain represents a chain of custody of authentication
and other trace information (AAR) related to a message, signed by each handler
of the message. Each link in the chain (AMS) is designed to be brittle, insofar
as it survives only until the next modification of the message. However, the
sequence of intermediaries in the handling chain (AS) is designed to remain
intact over the entirety of the chain.</t>

<t>The ARC Chain can be conceptualized through an analogy with the chain of custody
for legal evidence.  The material evidence itself is sealed within an
tamper-proof bag (AMS) each time.  When handed to a new party, that party both
vouches for the state of the received evidence container (AAR) and signs for
the evidence on a chain of custody report form (AS). As with all analogies,
this one should not be taken to interpretive extremes, but primarily used as a
conceptual framework.</t>

<t>An ARC Chain that is valid and passing has the attributes listed above in
<xref target="protocol-elements"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="optional-participation" title="Optional Participation">

<t>Validating an existing chain and then adding your own ARC Set to a message
allows you to claim responsibility for handling the message and modifications,
if any, done by your ADMD to benefit message delivery downstream. However, no
ADMD is obligated to perform these actions.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="broad-responsibility-to-seal" title="Broad Responsibility to Seal">

<t>Any mediator (<xref target="RFC5598"/>, section 5) that modifies a message may seal its own changes. 
ARC is not solely intended for perimeter MTAs.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="one-chain-to-rule-them-all" title="One Chain to Rule Them All">

<t>A message can have only one ARC Chain on it at a time (see <xref target="i-defn"/>).  Once
broken, the chain cannot be continued, as the chain of custody is no longer
valid and responsibility for the message has been lost. For further discussion
of this topic and the designed restriction which prevents chain continuation or 
re-establishment, see <xref target="ARC-USAGE"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="sealing-is-always-safe" title="Sealing is Always Safe">

<t>Even when an ARC Chain is valid and passes, its value is limited to very
specific cases. An ARC Chain is specifically designed to provide additional information to a
receiver evaluating message delivery in the context of an authentication failure and 
otherwise be benign.
Specifically:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>properly adding an ARC Set to a message does not damage or invalidate an existing chain,</t>
  <t>sealing a chain when you did not modify a message does not negatively affect the chain, and</t>
  <t>validating a message exposes no new threat vectors (see <xref target="sec-con"/>).</t>
</list></t>

<t><spanx style="emph">INFORMATIONAL</spanx>: If an ADMD is unsure whether it will be re-emitting and/or
modifying a message, it may elect to seal all inbound mail.  For complex or
nested ADMD relationships such as found in some hosted mail solutions, this
“inbound seal” can be used to facilitate traversal of internal boundaries as
well as properly conveying incoming state to any egress MTAs that may need to
assert a seal upon exit from the ADMD. Since these internal relationships are
highly implementation dependent, this protocol definition can not usefully
explore such usage except to note that it is intentionally allowed within the
scope of this specification.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="the-arc-header-fields" title="The ARC Header Fields">

<section anchor="i-defn" title="Instance (‘i=’) Tag">

<t>The header fields comprising a single ARC Set are identified by a common
“instance” tag value. The instance tag is a string in each header field value
that complies with
the “tag-spec” ABNF found in Section 3.2 of <xref target="RFC6376"/>.  The tag-name is 
“i” and the value is the text representation of a positive
integer, indicating the position in the ARC sequence this set occupies, where
the first ARC Set is numbered 1.  In ABNF terms:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
   position = 1*2DIGIT ; 1 - 50
   instance = [FWS] %x69 [FWS] "=" [FWS] position [FWS] ";"
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Valid ARC Sets MUST have exactly one instance of each header field (of three) for a given
instance value and signing algorithm.</t>

<t>(<spanx style="emph">INFORMATIONAL:</spanx> Initial development of ARC is only being 
done with a single allowed signing algorithm, but parallel work in the <eref target="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/dcrup/about/">DCRUP working 
group</eref> is expanding that. For handling
multiple signing algorithms, see <xref target="ARC-MULTI"/>.)</t>

<t>The ‘i’ tag value can range from 1-50 (inclusive).</t>

<t>ARC Chains longer than the defined maximum count MUST be marked as failed.</t>

<t><spanx style="emph">INFORMATIONAL</spanx>: 
Because the AMS and AS header field values are made up of tag-spec constructs,
the i= tag may be found anywhere within the header field value, but is
represented throughout this spec in the initial position for convenience.
Implementers are encouraged to place the i= tag at the beginning of the field
value to facilitate human inspection of the headers.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="aar-defn" title="ARC-Authentication-Results (AAR)">

<t>The ARC-Authentication-Results header field is syntactically and semantically
identical,
except for the header field name itself and its instance tag,
to an Authentication-Results header field (defined in Section 2.2 of
<xref target="I-D-7601bis"/>).</t>

<t>Formally, the header field is specified as follows using ABNF <xref target="RFC5234"/>:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
arc-info = instance [CFWS] ";" authres-payload
arc-authres-header = "ARC-Authentication-Results:" [CFWS] arc-info

regardless of how many Authentication-Results headers are on the message.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="ams-defn" title="ARC-Message-Signature (AMS)">

<t>The ARC-Message-Signature header field is simplified version of 
a DKIM-Signature header field <xref target="RFC6376"/>, 
with the following modifications:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>There is an “i” tag, as described in <xref target="i-defn"/>.</t>
  <t>There is no “v” tag defined for the AMS header. As required for undefined

</list></t>

<t>ARC-related header fields (ARC-Seal, ARC-Message-Signture, ARC-Authentication-Results) 
MUST NOT be included in the content covered by the signature in the signature in this header field.</t>

<t>The AMS SHOULD include any DKIM-Signature header fields already present on the
message in the header fields covered by this signature.</t>

<t>Authentication-Results header fields MUST NOT be included since they are
likely to be deleted by downstream ADMDs (per Section 5 of <xref target="RFC7601"/>),
thereby breaking the AMS signature.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="as-defn" title="ARC-Seal (AS)">

<t>The ARC-Seal header field is syntactically and semantically
similar to a DKIM-Signature field, with the following exceptions:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">

  <t>The ARC-Seal covers none of the body content of the message.  It only covers
specific header fields as defined below: <xref target="implicit-as-h"/>. 
No body canonicalization is done.</t>
  <t>Only “relaxed” header canonicalization (Section 3.4.2 of <xref target="RFC6376"/>) is used.</t>
  <t>The only supported tags are “i” (from <xref target="i-defn"/> of this document),

<t>The Security Considerations of <xref target="RFC6376"/> and <xref target="RFC7601"/> apply directly to
this specification.</t>

<section anchor="header-size" title="Header Size">

<t>Inclusion of ARC Sets in the header of emails may cause problems for some
older or more constrained MTAs if they are unable to accept the greater 
size of the header.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="dns-ops" title="DNS Operations">

<t>Operators who receive a message bearing N ARC Sets have to complete up to N+1 
DNS queries to evaluate the chain (barring DNS redirection mechanisms which 
can increase the lookups for a given target value).  This has at least two effects:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>An attacker can send a message to an ARC participant with a concocted
sequence of ARC Sets bearing the domains of intended victims, and all of them
will be queried by the participant until a failure is discovered. The
difficulty of forging the signature values should limit the extent of this
load to domains under control of the attacker.</t>
  <t>DKIM only does one DNS check per signature, while this one can do many
(per chain).  Absent caching, slow DNS responses can cause SMTP timeouts;
and backlogged delivery queues on mediating systems. This could be exploited as
a DoS attack.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="message-content-suspicion" title="Message Content Suspicion">

<t>Recipients are cautioned to treat messages bearing ARC Sets with the
same suspicion that they apply to all other email messages. This includes
appropriate content scanning and other checks for potentially malicious
content. The handlers which are identified within the ARC Chain may be
used to provide input to local policy engines in cases where DMARC
validation fails (due to mediation impacting SPF attribution, DKIM validity
or alignment).</t>

<t>Note that a passing ARC Chain may not adequately mean that the message
is safe because:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>You have to trust all signatories; and</t>
  <t>Even trusted systems may have become compromised or may not properly authenticate
messages, so even with a chain of trusted participants, the message
might still never have authenticated in the first place (which is why you
have the AAR to inspect) or could have been subject to unintended modifications.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="is-arc-ok" title="Evaluating the Efficacy of the ARC Protocol (Experimental Considerations)">

<t>The ARC protocol is designed to mitigate some of the most common failure
conditions for email which transits intermediary handlers en route to the
final recipient. Some of these problems have happened due to the adoption
of the DMARC protocol <xref target="RFC7489"/> and are listed in <xref target="RFC6377"/> and <xref target="RFC7960"/>.</t>

<t>As the ARC protocol becomes standardized and implemented amongst 
intermediary handlers, the following aspects should be evaluated in order to
determine the success of the protocol in accomplishing the intended benefits.</t>

<t>NOTE: Terminology within this section does NOT follow <xref target="RFC2119"/> interpretation. 
This section represents the current thoughts of the working group regarding 
unanswered questions related to the protocol. Wider deployment will inform 
these topics and probably expand them.</t>

<section anchor="success-consideration" title="Success Consideration">

<t>Currently, many receivers have heuristically determined overrides in order to
rescue mail from intermediary-caused failures. Many of those overrides rely on
inferrence rather than direct evidence.</t>

<t>ARC will be a success if, for ARC sealed messages, receivers are able to
implment ARC-based algorithmic decisions based on the direct evidence found
within the ARC Chain. This is especially relevant for DMARC processing when the
DKIM d= value is aligned with the rfc5322.From author domain.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="failure-considerations" title="Failure Considerations">

<t>The intent of ARC is to be at most value-add and at worst benign. If ARC opens
up significant new vectors for abuse (see <xref target="sec-con"/>) then
this protocol will be a failure. Note that weaknesses inherent in the mail
protocols ARC is built upon (such as DKIM replay attacks and other known issues)
are not new vectors which can be attributed to this specification.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="open-questions" title="Open Questions">

<t>The following open questions are academic and have no clear answer at the time
of the development of the protocol. However, wide-spread deployment should be
able to gather the necessary data to answer some or all of them.</t>

<section anchor="value-of-the-arc-seal-as-header" title="Value of the ARC-Seal (AS) Header">

<t>Data should be collected to show if the ARC-Seal (AS) provides value beyond the ARC
Message Signature (AMS) for either making delivery decisions or catching malicious
actors trying to craft or replay malicious chains.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="dns-overhead" title="DNS Overhead">

<t>Longer ARC Chains will require more queries to retrieve the keys for validating
the chain. While this is not believed to be a security issue (see <xref target="dns-ops"/>),
it is unclear how much overhead will truly be added. This is similar to some of
the initial processing and query load concerns which were debated at the time
of the DKIM specification development.</t>

<t>Data should be collected to better understand usable length and distribution of
lengths found in valid ARC Chains along with the the DNS impact of processing
ARC Chains.</t>

<t>An effective operational maximum will have to be developed through deployment
experience in the field.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="distinguishing-valuable-from-worthless-trace-information" title="Distinguishing Valuable from Worthless Trace Information">

<t>There are several edge cases where the information in the AAR can make the
difference between message delivery or rejection. For example, if there is a
well known mailing list that ARC seals but doesn’t do its own initial DMARC
enforcement, a Final Receiver with this knowledge could make a delivery decision
based upon the authentication information it sees in the corresponding AAR
header.</t>

<t>Certain trace information in the AAR is useful/necessary in the construction of
DMARC reports. It would be beneficial to identify the value-add of having
intermediary-handled mail flow information added into the DMARC reports going
back to senders.</t>

<t>Certain receivers believe the entire set of trace information would be valuable
to feed into machine learning systems to identify fraud and/or provide other
signals related to message delivery.</t>

<t>It is unclear what trace information will be valuable for all receivers,
regardless of size.</t>

<t>Data should be collected on what trace information receivers are using that
provides useful signals that affect deliverability, and what portions of the
trace data are left untouched or provide no useful information.</t>

<t>Since many such systems are intentionally proprietary or confidential to prevent
gaming by abusers, it may not be viable to reliably answer this particular
question.  The evolving nature of attacks can also shift the landscape of
“useful” information over time.</t>

<t>(This section is re-inserted for background information 
from <xref target="ARC-DRAFT-06"/> and earlier versions.)</t>

<t>The specification of the ARC framework is driven by the following high-level
goals, security considerations, and practical operational requirements.</t>

<section anchor="primary-design-criteria" title="Primary Design Criteria">

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Provide a verifiable “chain of custody” for email messages;</t>
  <t>Not require changes for originators of email;</t>
  <t>Support the verification of the ARC header field set by each hop in the
handling chain;</t>
  <t>Work at Internet scale; and</t>
  <t>Provide a trustable mechanism for the communication of Authentication-Results
across trust boundaries.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="out-of-scope" title="Out of Scope">

<t>ARC is not a trust framework. Users of the ARC header fields are cautioned against
making unsubstantiated conclusions when encountering a “broken” ARC sequence.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="appendix-b-example-usage" title="Appendix B - Example Usage">

<t>[[ Note: The following examples were mocked up early in the definition
process for the spec. They no longer reflect the current definition and
need various updates which will be included in a future draft.
