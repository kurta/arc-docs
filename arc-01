--- abstract

The Authenticated Received Chain (ARC) protocol creates a mechanism whereby a series
of handlers of a message can conduct authentication of a message as it passes
among them on the way to its destination, and record the status of that
authentication at each step along the handling path, for use by the final
recipient in making choices about the disposition of the message.

# Introduction

Modern email authentication techniques such as the Sender Policy Framework
(SPF) {{RFC7208}} and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) [RFC6376] have become
ubiquitious.  However, they are stymied by a small number of common
applications, most notably mailing list managers, as these applications have
handling properties that prevent these authentication schemes from universal
effectiveness.  These issues are described in substantial detail in those
protocols' defining documents as well as in {{RFC6377}}.

In an effort to reduce the success of fraudulent email campaigns, there has
been an effort to develop and deploy technologies that use SPF and DKIM to
assure legitimate use of the identity of the apparent message author, i.e., the
visible "From:" field in a message.  To this end, Domain-based Mail
Authentication, Reporting and Compliance (DMARC) {{RFC7489}} has been developed
and deployed.  However, its deployment in environments where mailing lists are
used has had the negative impacts predicted in the documents listed above.

What is needed is a mechanism by which legitimate alteration of a message,
invalidating SPF and DKIM, does not ultimately result in a rejection of an
email message on delivery.  An Authenticated Received Chain (ARC), described
here, provides a superset of the functionality of DKIM in order to provide to
the final message recipient a more complete view into the handling chain of a
message and the points in that chain where alterations of the content may have
occurred.  Equipped with this more compelte information, the final recipient
can make a more informed handling choice, reducing or eliminating the
false postives inherent in use of DKIM and/or SPF themselves.

# Overview

In DKIM, every participating signing agent attaches a signature that is based
on the content of the message, local policy, and the domain name of the
participating Administrative Management Domain (ADMD).  Any verifier can
process such a signature; a verified signature means the message content that
was "covered" by the signature has not been altered since the signature was
applied.  The signatures themselves are generally independent of one another.

By contrast, this protocol seeks to have each signature be able to convey the
following pieces of information:

1.  As with DKIM, an assertion that, for a passing signature, the domain name
in the signature takes some responsibility for handling of the message and that
the message is unchanged since that signature was applied;

2.  A further assertion that, at the time that same ADMD processed the message,
the various assertions already attached to the message by other ADMDs were or
were not valid;

3.  A further assertion that combines and protects the above against alteration
by later handlers.

This protocol accomplishes each of these by adding a new header field to the
message for each of them, as follows:

* ARC-Authentication-Results:  (referred to below as "AAR") virtually identical
in syntax to an Authentication-Results field {{RFC7601}}, this field records
the results of all message authentication checks done by the recording ADMD at
the time the message arrived;
* ARC-Message-Signature:  (referred to below as "AMS") virtually identical in
syntax to DKIM-Signature, this field contains the assertions about the message
header and body as they existed at the time of handling by the ADMD adding it;
and 
* ARC-Seal:  (referred to below as "AS") highly similar in structure and format
to a DKIM-Signature, this field applies a digital signature that protects the
integrity of all three of these new fields when they are added by an ADMD, plus
all instances of these fields added by prior ADMDs.

A distinguishing feature of all of these is that an ARC participant always adds
all of them before relaying a message to the next handling agent en route to
its destination.  Moreover, as described in Section {{i-defn}}, they each have an
"instance" number that increases with each ADMD in the handling chain so that
their original order can be preserved and the three of them can be processed as
a group.


# Terminology

This section defines terms used in the rest of the document. 

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in {{RFC2119}}. 

Readers are encouraged to be familiar with the contents of {{RFC5598}}, and in
particular, the potential roles of intermediaries in the delivery of email.

Syntax descriptions use Augmented BNF (ABNF) {{RFC5234}}. 

A single group of the header fields introduced in Section 2 is called an "ARC
Set", and the complete sequence of these groups is called an "Authenticated
Received Chain" or merely an "ARC chain".  Although the "Received" header field is
typically not included in the signed content, the name is based on the notion
that this is in essence a cryptographically signed series of header fields that
attest to the handling chain of a message much as Received fields always have.

# Instance ('i=') Tags {#i-defn}

The header fields comprising a single ARC set are identified by the presence of
a string in the value portion of the header field that complies with
the "tag-spec" ABNF found in Section 3.2 of {{RFC6376}}.  The tag-name is always
the single character "i" and the value is the text representation of a positive
integer, indicating the position in the ARC sequence this set occupies, where
the first ARC set is numbered 1.  In ABNF terms:

       instance = [FWS] %x69 [FWS] "=" [FWS] 1*DIGIT [FWS] ";"

At any delivery stage, it is an error if any ARC set is invalid (i.e., does not
contain exactly one of the three header fields defined by this protocol).

Note that because the AMS and AS header field values are made up of tag-spec
constructs, the i= tag may be found anywhere within the header field value, but is
represented throughout this spec in the initial position for convenience. Implementers
SHOULD seek to start with the i= tag to facilitate human inspection of the headers.

## Valid Range for "Instance" 'i' Tag Value {#i-hdr}

The 'i' tag value can range from 1-1024 (inclusive).

ARC implementations MUST support at least ten (10) intermediary steps.

More than fifty (50) intermediaries is considered extremely unlikely so
ARC chains with more than fifty intermediaries may be marked with "cv=fail".

# The ARC Header Fields

The three header fields that are part of this specification borrow heavily from
existing specifications.  Rather than repeating all of the formal definitions
that are being recycled in ARC, this document instead only describes and
specifies changes in syntax and semantics.

## ARC-Authentication-Results (AAR) {#aar-defn}

\[\[ Note: The intent of the AAR header is to provide the necessary information
for meaningful DMARC reporting back to the originating ADMD. As such, it needs
to include additional information than the user-focused Authentication-Results
header {{RFC7601}} but the details of that incremental information have not yet
been fully determined. ]]

The ARC-Authentication-Results header field is defined.  It is syntactically
and semantically identical to an Authentication-Results header field {{RFC7601}} (A-R),
as is the mechanism by which it is constructed, with the following exception:

* There is an "i" tag, as described in Section {{i-defn}}.

The instance identifier MUST be separated from the rest of the Authentication-Results
value contents with a semi-colon (';', 0x3b).

An ARC signer generates this field in the same way that a conventional
A-R field would be generated.

The purpose of this header field is to incorporate into the record the success
or failure of any authentication done on the message upstream of the
participating ADMD, to validate and continue the authentication chain.

In processing, some architectures will generate multiple A-R records for the 
same authserv-id. In such cases, the resinfo value from each of the A-R records should 
be concatenated into a single record just as they would have been if they were
generated in a single A-R record.

## ARC-Message-Signature (AMS) {#ams-defn}

The ARC-Message-Signature header field is defined.  It is syntactically and
semantically identical to a DKIM-Signature header field {{RFC6376}}, as is the
mechanism by which it is constructed, with the following exceptions:

* There is an "i" tag, as described in Section {{i-defn}}.
* There is no "v" tag.
* ARC-Seal header fields MUST never be included in the content covered
by the signature in this header field.

It is generally advisable to include in the header fields covered by this
signature any DKIM-Signature header fields already present on the message.

Including Authentication-Results header fields is not encouraged since they are
likely to be deleted by downstream ADMDs, thereby breaking the AMS signature.

As with a DKIM-Signature, the purpose of this header field is to allow the ADMD
generating it to take some responsibility for handling this message as it
progresses toward delivery.

## ARC-Seal (AS) {#as-defn}

The ARC-Seal header field is defined.  It is syntactically and semantically
similar to a DKIM-Signature field, with the following exceptions:

*  There is an "i" tag, as described in Section {{i-defn}}.
*  The ARC-Seal covers none of the body content of the message.  It only covers
specific header fields.  (See below: {{implicit-as-h}}.)  As a result, no body
canonicalization is done.  Further, only "relaxed" header canonicalization
(Section 3.4.2 of {{RFC6376}}) is used.
*  The only supported tags are "a", "b", "d, "i", "s", and "t", and their
definitions are copied from Section 3.5 of {{RFC6376}}.
*  An additional tag, "cv" is defined.  (See below: {{cv-defn}})

The purpose of this field is to assure the integrity of the ARC set being added
by the ADMD generating this header field, and moreover to ensure no tampering
with the ARC overall.

### The 'cv' Tag

A new tag "cv" (chain validation) is defined, which indicates the state of the
ARC chain as evaluated when it arrived at the ADMD adding this header field.
It includes one of three possible values:

* none:  There was no chain on the message when it arrived for validation;
typically occurs when the message arrives at a Message Transfer Agent (MTA)
from a Message Submission Agent (MSA) or when any upstream MTAs may not be
participating in ARC handling;
* fail:  The message has a chain whose validation failed;
* pass:  The message has a chain whose validation succeeded.

In ABNF terms:

     seal-cv-tag = %x63.76 [FWS] "=" [FWS]
                   ("none" / "fail" / "pass")

### Selected Header Fields {#implicit-as-h}

The ARC-Seal signature is an encryption of the hash of the concatenation of the
canonicalized form of the ARC sets present on the message at the time of
sealing, in increasing instance order, starting at 1, including the one being
added at the time of sealing the message.

Within a set, the header fields are presented in the following order:

1.  ARC-Authentication-Results
2.  ARC-Message-Signature
3.  ARC-Seal

Where the ARC-Seal is the one being generated, it is presented to the hash
function in its final form except with an empty "b=" value, in the same manner
by which a DKIM-Signature signs itself.

# Verifier Actions {#cv-calc}

The verifier takes the following steps to determine the current state of the
ARC on the message:

1. Collect all ARC sets currently on the message.  If there were none, the ARC
state is "none" and the algorithm stops here.
2. If any ARC set is invalid (e.g., does not contain exactly one of each of the
three ARC-specific header fields), then the chain state is "fail" and the
algorithm stops here.
3. Conduct verification of the ARC-Message-Signature header field bearing the
highest instance number.  If this verification fails, then the chain state is
"fail" and the algorithm stops here.
4. For each ARC-Seal from the "N"th instance to the first, apply the following
logic:
   A. If the value of the "cv" tag on that seal is "fail", the chain state is
the same as that value and the algorithm stops here.
   B. If the instance number being processed is not 1 and the value of the
"cv" tag is "none", the chain state is "fail" and the algorithm stops here.
   C. Prepare a hash function corresponding to the "a" tag of the ARC-Seal.
   D. Compute the canonicalized form of the ARC header fields, in the order
described in Section {{implicit-as-h}}, using the "relaxed" header
canonicalization defined in (Section 3.4.2 of {{RFC6376}}.  Pass them to the
hash function.
   E. Retrieve the final digest from the hash function.
   F. Retrieve the public key identified by the "s" and "d" tags in the
ARC-Seal, as described in Section {{key-mgmt}}.
   G. Determine whether the signature portion ("b" tag) of the ARC-Seal and
the digest computed above are valid according to the public key.
   H. If the signature is not valid, the chain state is "fail" and the
algorithm stops here.
5. If all seals pass validation, then the chain state is "pass", and the
algorithm is complete.

The verifier should record the cv state for subsequent use by any sealing which
may be done later (potentially after message modification) within the same
trust boundary. The cv state may be recorded by sealing at the time of verification
in an additional ARC set or may be recorded out of band depending on the 
architecture of the ADMD.

# Signer Actions

This section includes a walk-through of the actions an ARC signing
implementation takes when presented with a message.

The signing agent should undertake the following steps:

1. Do any authentication steps that the ADMD normally does:
  A. If a message is traveling within the same trust boundary, this would
include any transitive trust conveyance with the message;
  B. If a message is coming from outside the same trust boundary, this would
include any SPF / DKIM / DMARC / other authentication evaluation steps.
2. Do any DKIM signing or authentication assertion steps that the ADMD normally
does.
3. Generate and optionally attach to the message an Authentication-Results
header field using the ADMD's authserv-id (see Section 2.5 of {{RFC7601}})
indicating whatever authentication might have been done by the MTA, or possibly
indicate that none was done.
  A. If an ARC chain exists on the message, then set "N" equal to the highest
instance number found on the chain (i=); otherwise set "N" equal to zero for
the following steps.
3. Generate and attach to the message an ARC-Authentication-Results header
field using instance number N+1 and the same content from the previous step.
4. Generate and attach to the message an ARC-Message-Signature header field
using the general algorithm described in Section 5 of {{RFC6376}} and as modified
in Section 5.1 above, using instance number N+1.
5. Generate and attach to the message an ARC-Seal header field using the
general algorithm described in Section 5.3 above, using a chain validation
status as determined in {{cv-calc}} and instance number N+1.

# Key Management

The public keys for ARC header fields follow the same requirements, syntax and
semantics as those for DKIM signatures, described in Section 3.6 of {{RFC6376}}.
Operators may use distinct selectors and/or domains for the ARC header fields
at their own discretion. 

# ARC Set Validity

## Assessing Chain Validity Violations

There are a wide variety of ways in which the ARC set of header fields can be broken.
Receivers need to be wary of ascribing motive to such breakage although patterns
of common behaviour may provide some basis for adjusting local policy decisions.

This specification is exclusively focused on well-behaved, participating intermediaries
that result in a valid chain of ARC-related header fields. The value of such a well-formed,
valid chain needs to be interpreted with care since malicious content can be
easily introduced by otherwise well-intended senders through machine or account
compromises. All normal content-based analysis still needs to be performed on any
messages bearing a valid chain of ARC header sets.

## Marking and Sealing Invalid Chains

The header fields signed by the AS header field b= value in the case of a major
violation MUST be only the matching 'i=' instance headers created by the MTA
which detected the malformed chain, as if this newest ARC set was the only set
present. (This is the same procedure required for handling major/structural
validity problems.)

## Responding to ARC Validity Violations

If a receiver determines that the ARC chain has failed, the
receiver MAY signal the breakage through the extended SMTP response code 5.7.7 {{RFC3463}} 
"message integrity failure" {{ENHANCED-STATUS}} and corresponding SMTP response code.

## Recording the Results of ARC Evaluation

Receivers MAY add an "arc=[pass|fail|policy]" method annotation into a locally-affixed
Authentication-Results {{RFC7601}} header field along with any salient comment(s).

### Output Information from an ARC Evaluation

The evaluation of a series of ARC sets results in the following data which MAY be
used to inform local-policy decisions:

* A list of the "d=" domains found in the validated (all) ARC-Seal header fields;
* The "d=" domain found in the most recent (highest instance number) AMS header field
(since that is the only one necessarily validated)

### Reporting ARC Effects for DMARC Local Policy - Interim

\[\[ Note: Discussion on the IETF DMARC-WG list has indicated some interest in more substantial
reporting for analytic purposes. To support that effort, the following guidance is 
provided only as an interim, minimal data set. A more complete reporting construct
will be specified in a related spec - TBD. (see also the note at {{aar-defn}}) ]]

Receivers SHOULD indicate situations in which ARC evaluation influenced the
results of their local policy determination. DMARC reporting of ARC-informed decisions
is augmented by adding a local_policy comment explanation as follows: 

~~~~~~~~~~
&lt;policy_evaluated>
  &lt;disposition>delivered&lt;/disposition>
  &lt;dkim>fail&lt;/dkim>
  &lt;spf>fail&lt;/spf>
  &lt;reason>
   &lt;type>local_policy&lt;/type>
   &lt;comment>arc=pass ams=d1.example d=d1.example,d2.example&lt;/comment>
  &lt;/reason>
&lt;/policy_evaluated>
~~~~~~~~~~

# Privacy Considerations

The ARC chain provides a verifiable record of the handlers for a message.
Anonymous remailers will probably not find this to match their operating goals.

# IANA Considerations

This specification adds three new header fields as defined below.

## Authentication-Results Method Registry Update 

This draft adds one item to the IANA "Email Authentication Methods" registry:

* Method : arc

  Defined: {{&SELF}}

  ptype: header

  Property: chain evaluation result

  Value: chain evaluation result status (see {{seal-hdr}})

# Implementation Status {#implstat}

\[\[ Note to the RFC Editor: Please remove this section before 
publication along with the reference to {{RFC6982}}. ]]

This section records the status of known implementations of the protocol
defined by this specification at the time of posting of this Internet-Draft,
and is based on a proposal described in {{RFC6982}}.  The description of
implementations in this section is intended to assist the IETF in its decision
processes in progressing drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any
individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.
Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information presented here
that was supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their features.
Readers are advised to note that other implementations may exist.

According to {{RFC6982}}, "this will allow reviewers and working groups to
assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of running code,
which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation and feedback that have
made the implemented protocols more mature.  It is up to the individual working
groups to use this information as they see fit".

This information is known to be correct as of the third interoperability 
test event which was held on 2016-06-17.

# Security Considerations {#sec-con}

The Security Considerations of {{RFC6376}} and {{RFC7601}} apply directly to
this specification.

Inclusion of ARC sets in the header of emails may cause problems for some
older or more constrained MTAs if they are unable to accept the greater 
size of the header.

Operators who receive a message bearing N ARC sets has to complete N+1 
DNS queries to evaluate the chain (barring DNS redirection mechanisms which 
can increase the lookups for a given target value).  This has at least two effects:

  1. An attacker can send a message to an ARC partipant with a concocted
sequence of ARC sets bearing the domains of intended victims, and all of them
will be queried by the participant until a failure is discovered.

  2.  DKIM only does one DNS check per signature, while this one can do many.
Absent caching, slow DNS responses can cause SMTP timeouts; this could be
exploited as a DoS attack.

## Message Content Suspicion

Recipients are cautioned to treat messages bearing ARC sets with the
same suspicion that they apply to all other email messages. This includes
appropriate content scanning and other checks for potentially malicious
content. The handlers which are identified within the ARC-Seal chain may be
used to provide input to local policy engines in cases where the sending
system's DKIM-Signature does not validate.

#### Example 2, Step B: Message from list forwarded

The message is delivered to a mailbox at gmail.com  
Processing at gmail.com:

-   gmail.com performs usual authentication checks
-   gmail.com adds Auth-Results: and Received: header
-   Determines that message fails DMARC
-   Checks for ARC-Seal: header; finds one
-   Validates the signature in the ARC-Seal: header, which covers the ARC-Authentication-Results: header
-   Uses the ARC-Auth-Results: values, but:
-   Instead of delivering message, prepares to forward message per user settings
-   Applies usual DKIM signature
-   gmail.com adds it’s own ARC-Seal: header, contents of which are
    -       version
    -       sequence number (“i=2”)
    -       hash algorithm (SHA256 as example)
    -       timestamp (“t=”)
    -       selector for key (“s=notary01”)
    -       domain for key (“d=gmail.com”)
    -       headers included  in hash (“h=ARC-Authentication-Results:ARC-Seal”)
    -       Note: algorithm requires only ARC-Seals with lower sequence # be included, in ascending order
    -       signature of the header hash

### Example 2: Message received by Recipient

Let’s say that the Recipient is example.com  
Processing at example.com:

-       example.com performs usual authentication checks
-       example.com adds Auth-Results: header, Received header
-       Determines that message fails DMARC
-       Checks for ARC-Seal: header; finds two
-       Validates the signature in the highest numbered (“i=2”) ARC-Seal: header, which covers all previous ARC-Seal: and ARC-Authentication-Results: headers
-       Validates the other ARC-Seal header (“i=1”), which covers the ARC-Authentication-Results: header
-       example.com uses the ARC-Authentication-Results: values

Here’s what the message looks like at this point:

### Message is then received at example.org

 

#### Example 3, Step A: Message forwarded to list members with source

Processing at example.org:

-   example.org performs authentication checks
-   example.org applies standard DKIM signature
-   Checks for ARC-Seal: header; finds one (i=1)
-   Validates the signature in the ARC-Seal (i=1): header, which covers the d1.example ARC-Message-Signature: header
-   example.org adds ARC-Auth-Results header
-   example.org adds usual Received: header
-   example.org adds a DKIM-Signature
-   example.org adds a ARC-Seal header, contents of which are
    -       sequence number (“i=2”)
    -       hash algorithm (SHA256 as example)
    -       timestamp (“t=”)
    -       chain validity ("cv=")
    -       selector for key (“s=seal2015”)
    -       domain for key (“d=example.org”)
    -       signature ("b=")

Here’s the message as it exits Step A:

#### Example 3, Step B: Message from list forwarded with source

The message is delivered to a mailbox at gmail.com  
Processing at gmail.com:

-   gmail.com performs usual authentication checks
-   gmail.com adds Auth-Results: and Received: header
-   Determines that message fails DMARC
-   Checks for ARC-Seal: header; finds two
-   Validates the signature in the ARC-Seal (i=2): header, which covers the ARC-Authentication-Results: header
-   Validates the signature in the ARC-Seal (i=1): header, which covers the d1.example ARC-Message-Signature: header
-   Uses the ARC-Auth-Results: values, but:
-   Instead of delivering message, prepares to forward message per user settings
-   Applies usual DKIM signature
-   gmail.com adds it’s own ARC-Seal: header, contents of which are
    -       version
    -       sequence number (“i=2”)
    -       hash algorithm (SHA256 as example)
    -       timestamp (“t=”)
    -       selector for key (“s=notary01”)
    -       domain for key (“d=gmail.com”)
    -       Note: algorithm requires only ARC-Seals with lower sequence # be included, in ascending order
    -       signature of the chain

-       example.com adds Auth-Results: header, Received header
-       Determines that message fails DMARC

-       Validates the signature in the highest numbered (“i=2”) ARC-Seal: header, which covers all previous ARC-Seal: and ARC-Authentication-Results: headers
-       Validates the other ARC-Seal header (“i=2”), which covers the ARC-Authentication-Results: header
-       Validates the other ARC-Seal header (“i=1”), which covers the d1.example ARC-Message-Signature: header
