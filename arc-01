--- abstract

Authenticated Received Chain (ARC) permits an organization which is creating or
handling email to indicate its involvement with the handling process.  It defines
a set of cryptographically signed header fields in a manner analagous to
that of DKIM.  Assertion of responsibility is
validated through a cryptographic signature and by querying the Signer's domain
directly to retrieve the appropriate public key. Changes in the message that
might break DKIM can be identified through the ARC set of header fields.

# Introduction

The development of strong domain authentication through Sender Policy Framework
(SPF) {{RFC7208}} and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) {{RFC6376}} has led to
the implementation of the DMARC framework {{RFC7489}} which extends the
authentication to the author's "From:" (RFC5322.From) field and permits
publishing policies for non-compliant messages.  Implicit within the DMARC
framework is a requirement that any intermediaries between the source system
and ultimate receiver system need to preserve the validity of the DKIM
signature; however, there are common legitimate email practices which break the DKIM
validation ({{RFC7960}}). This specification defines an Authenticated
Received Chain (ARC). ARC addresses the problems with the untrustworthiness of the
standard Received header field sequence. Through the information tracked in the ARC
series of headers, receivers can develop a more
nuanced interpretation to guide any local policies related to messages that
arrive with broken domain authentication (DMARC).

Forgery of the Received header fields is a common tactic used by bad actors. One of
the goals of this specification defines a comparable set of trace header fields
which can be relied upon by receivers, assuming all ADministrative
Management Domain (ADMD) ({{RFC5598}}, section 2.2)  intermediary 
handlers of a message participate in ARC.

The Authentication-Results (A-R) mechanism {{RFC7601}} permits the output of an email
authentication evaluation process to be transmitted from the evaluating
agent to a consuming agent that uses the information.  On its own, A-R
is believable only within a trust domain.  ARC provides a protection mechanism for
the data, permiting the communication to cross trust domain boundaries.

# Requirements

The specification of the ARC framework is driven by the following high-level
goals, security considerations, and practical operational requirements.

## Primary Design Criteria

* Provide a verifiable "chain of custody" for email messages;

* Not require changes for originators of email;

* Support the verification of the ARC header field set by each hop in the 
handling chain;

* Work at Internet scale; and

* Provide a trustable mechanism for the communication of Authentication-Results
across trust boundaries.

## Out of Scope

ARC is not a trust framework. Users of the ARC header fields are cautioned against 
making unsubstantiated conclusions when encountering a "broken" ARC sequence.

## Utility

The ARC-related set of header fields can be used (when validated) to determine the
path that an email message has taken between the originating system and receiver.
Subject to the cautions mentioned in {{sec-con}}, this
information can assist in determining any local policy overrides to for
violations of origination domain authentication policies.

# Terminology

This section defines terms used in the rest of the document. 

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in {{RFC2119}}. 

Readers are encouraged to be familiar with the contents of {{RFC5598}}, and in
particular, the potential roles of intermediaries in the delivery of email.

Syntax descriptions use Augmented BNF (ABNF) {{RFC5234}}. 

# Overview

When an email message is received without a properly validated originating domain, the
inability to believe the accuracy of a series of Received header fields prevents
receiving systems from having a way to infer anything about the handling of the
message by looking at the ADMDs through which the message has traveled. 

With ARC, participating ADMDs are able to 
securely register their handling of an email message. If all mediators ({{RFC5598}})
participate in the ARC process, receivers will be able to rely upon the chain 
and make local policy decisions informed by that information.

The ARC set of header fields provides a method by which participating intermediaries
can indicate the hand-offs for email messages.

# Definition

This specification defines three new header fields:

*  Header field name:  ARC-Seal (abbreviated below as AS)
*  Header field name:  ARC-Message-Signature (abbreviated below as AMS)
*  Header field name:  ARC-Authentication-Results (abbreviated below as AAR)

Collectively, these header fields form a connected set of attribution
information by which receivers can identify the handling path for a message. 
As described below, a distinct set of these fields share a common sequence number,
identified in an "i=" tag. Such a correlated group of header fields is referred
to as an "ARC set".  

Specific references to individual header fields use the header field names to distinguish
such references.

The ARC sets SHOULD be added at the top of a message header as it transits MTAs that
do authentication checks, so some idea of how far away the checks were done can
be inferred. They are therefore considered to be a trace field as defined in
{{RFC5321}}, and all of the related definitions in that document apply. 

Relative ordering of different trace header fields (the ARC sets, DKIM, Received, 
etc.) is unimportant for this specification. In general, trace header fields, 
such as ARC,
SHOULD be added at the top of the email header fields, but receivers MUST be able to 
process the header fields from wherever they are found in the message header.
Ordering amongst the individual ARC header fields and sets is specified 
below and MUST be followed for proper canonicalized signing and evaluation.

## Description of the New Header Fields

### ARC-Seal

ARC-Seal is a Structured Header Field as defined in Internet Message Format
({{RFC5322}}). All of the related definitions in that document apply. 

The ARC-Seal makes use of Tag=Value Lists as defined in {{RFC6376}}, Section 3.2.

The value of the header field consists of an authentication sequence
identifier, and a series of statements and supporting data. The statements
indicate relevant data about the signing of the ARC set.  The header field can
appear more than once in a single message, but each instance MUST have a unique
"i=" value.

The ARC-Seal header field includes a digital signature of all preceding ARC
message header fields on the message. 

#### Tags in the ARC-Seal Header Field Value {#seal-hdr}

The following tags are the only supported tags for an ARC-Seal field. All
of them MUST be present. Unknown tags MUST be ignored and do not affect
the validity of the header. 

* a = hash algorithm; syntax is the same as the "a=" tag defined in 
Section 3.5 of {{RFC6376}};
* b = digital signature; syntax is the same as the "b=" tag defined in
Section 3.5 of {{RFC6376}};
* cv = chain validation status: valid values: 

  * 'none' = no pre-existing chain; 
  * 'fail' = the chain as received does not or can not validate; or
  * 'pass' = valid chain received. 

* d = domain for key; syntax is the same as the "d=" tag defined
in Section 3.5 of {{RFC6376}};
* i = "instance" or sequence number; monotonically increasing at 
each "sealing" entity, beginning with '1', see {{i-hdr}} regarding the 
valid range
* s = selector for key; syntax is the same as the "s=" tag defined
in Section 3.5 of {{RFC6376}};
* t = timestamp; syntax is the same as the "t=" tag defined
in Section 3.5 of {{RFC6376}}.

##### Valid Range for "Instance" 'i' Tag Value {#i-hdr}

###### Minimum 'i' Tag Value

The minimum valid 'i' tag value is one (1).

###### Maximum 'i' Tag Value

ARC implementations MUST support at least ten (10) intermediary steps.

More than fifty (50) intermediaries is considered extremely unlikely so
ARC chains with more than fifty intermediaries may be marked with "cv=fail".

The maximum valid 'i' tag value is 1024, but values more that the supported number
of intermediaries are meaningless.

#### Differences between DKIM-Signature and ARC-Seal

No 'bh' value is defined for ARC-Seal, since only message header fields
are ever signed by the ARC-Seal.

ARC-Seal does not use the 'h' tag (the list of signed header fields) that is
defined for DKIM-Signatures because the list of applicable header fields is
fully determined by the construction rules (see {{implicit-as-h}}).

ARC-Seal does not use the 'c' (canonicalization) tag because only 'relaxed'
canonicalization {{RFC6376}} is allowed for ARC-Seal header field canonicalization.

#### Deterministic (Implicit) 'h' Tag Value for ARC-Seal {#implicit-as-h}

In this section, the term "scope" is used to indicate those header fields
signed by an ARC-Seal header field.  A number in parentheses indicates the
instance of that field, starting at 1.  The suffix "-no-b" is used with an
ARC-Seal field to indicate that its "b" field is empty at the time the
signature is computed, as described in Section 3.5 of {{RFC6376}}.  "AAR"
refers to ARC-Authentication-Results, "AMS" to ARC-Message-Signature, "AS" to
ARC-Seal, and "ASB" to an ARC-Seal with an empty "b" tag.

Generally, the scope of an ARC set for a message containing "n" ARC sets is the
concatenation of the following, for x (instance number) from 1 to n:

* AAR(x);
* AMS(x);
* ASB(x) if x = n, else AS(x)

Thus for a message with no seals (i.e., upon injection), the scope of the first
ARC set is AAR(1):AMS(1):ASB(1).  The ARC set thus generated would produce a
first ARC-Seal with a "b" value.  The next ARC set would include in its signed
content the prior scope, so it would have a scope of
AAR(1):AMS(1):AS(1):AAR(2):AMS(2):ASB(2).

Note: Typically header field sets appear within the header in descending instance
order.

#### Computing the 'b' Tag Value for ARC-Seal

The ARC-Seal generation process mirrors the procedure used for DKIM-Signature
fields described in Section 5 of {{RFC6376}} in that it is at first generated
with empty "b" field for the purpose of signature generation, and then the "b"
value is added just prior to adding the ARC-Seal field to the message.

In particular, signing calculation MUST be done in bottom-up order as specified
in Section 5.4.2 of {{RFC6376}} and as illustrated above {{implicit-as-h}}.

#### Determining the 'cv' Tag Value for ARC-Seal  {#cv-calc}

In order for a series of ARC sets to be considered valid, the following statements
MUST be satisfied:

0. The chain of ARC sets must have structural integrity (no sets or set component
  header fields missing, no duplicates, excessive hops (cf. {{i-hdr}}), etc.);
1. All ARC-Seal header fields MUST validate;
2. All ARC-Seal header fields MUST have a chain value (cv=) status of "pass" 
  (except the first which MUST be "none"); and
3. The newest (highest instance number (i=)) AMS header field MUST validate.

##### Pseudocode to Determine Chain Value Status:

In the algorith below, a "hop" is represented by the ARC set bearing a 
particular instance number. The number of hops is the same as the highest
instance number found in the ARC sets, or 0 (zero) if there are no ARC
sets found within the header.

"Success" means that the signature found in the referenced header validates
when checked against the specified content.

~~~~~~~~~~

if (lastest_hop.AS.cv == "fail") {
  terminate analysis - no further ARC processing
}

if (chain not structurally valid) {
  return "fail"
} else if (num_hops == 0) {
  return "none"
} else {
  if (validate(latest_hop.AMS) != success) {
    return "fail"
  } else {
    // note that instance is always >= 1 by definition
    for each hop (from highest instance to lowest) {  
      if ((hop_num > 1 and hop.ARC-Seal.cv == "pass") or
          (hop_num == 1 and hop.ARC-Seal.cv == "none")) {
        if (validate(hop.ARC-Seal) != success) {
          return "fail" 
        } 
      } else {
        return "fail"
      }
    }
  }

  return "pass"
}

~~~~~~~~~~

### ARC-Message-Signature 

The ARC-Message-Signature header field is a special variant of a DKIM-Signature
{{RFC6376}}.

The ARC-Message-Signature header field can appear multiple times in a single
message but each instance MUST have a unique "i=" value.

#### Differences between DKIM-Signature and ARC-Message-Signature

##### Header Fields Eligible For ARC-Message-Signature Inclusion {#h-ams-val}

Participants may include any other header fields within the scope of the
ARC-Message-Signature signature except that they MUST NOT include ARC-Seal
headers fields. In particular, including all DKIM-Signature header fields and 
all ARC-Authentication-Results header fields is RECOMMENDED. 
The advice regarding headers to include or avoid for ARC-Message-Signature is otherwise
identical to that specified in section 5.4
of {{RFC6376}}. 

##### "Canonicalization" 'c' Tag Value {#c-ams-val}

The ARC-Message-Signature header field MUST be created using the header
and body canonicalization rules mechanisms in Section 3.4 of {{RFC6376}}. The 
corresponding "c=" tag value MUST be specified in the AMS header field value.

##### "Instance" 'i' Tag Value {#i-ams-val}

Contrary to DKIM, the 'i' tag for ARC-Message-Signature identifies the 
sequential instance of the field, thus indicating that it is part of a particular
ARC set. That is, an ARC-Message-Signature, ARC-Seal, and ARC-Authentication-Results
all bearing an "i=" tag with the same value are part of the same ARC set 
(see {{seal-hdr}}). 

##### 'v' Tag Value  {#v-ams-val}

There is no "v" tag for ARC-Message-Signature. 

#### Computing the 'b' Tag Value for ARC-Message-Signature

As with DKIM-Signature and ARC-Seal header fields, the "b" tag of the
ARC-Message-Signature is empty until the signature is actually computed, and
only then is it added to the header field, before affixing the ARC-Message-Signature to the message.

As with ARC-Seal and DKIM-Signature header fields, the order of header fields signed
MUST be done in bottom-up order.

### ARC-Authentication-Results {#aar-defn}

ARC-Authentication-Results is a copy of the Authentication-Results header field
{{RFC7601}} value with the corresponding ARC-set instance ("i=") tag value
prefixed to the Authentication-Results value string.  Since
Authentication-Results headers are frequently deleted from a message's header
list, the AAR is created for archival purposes by each ARC-participating ADMD
outside of the trust boundary of the originating system.  

The instance identifier MUST be separated from the rest of the Authentication-Results
value contents with a semi-colon (';', 0x3b).

The value of the header field (after removing comments) consists of an instance
identifier, an authentication identifier, and then a series of statements and
supporting data, as described in {{RFC7601}}.  The header field can appear
multiple times in a single message but each instance MUST have a unique "i="
value.

##### 'i' Tag Value {#i-aar-val}

ARC-Authentication-Results requires inclusion of an "i=" tag before the
"authserv-id" which indicates the ARC set to which it belongs as described in
the previous section (see {{seal-hdr}}). 

The "i=" tag MUST be separated from the rest of the Authentication-Results
value contents with a semi-colon (';', 0x3b).

## Constructing the ARC-Seal Set {#build-hdrs}

The ARC-Seal is built in the same fashion as the analogous DKIM-Signature
{{RFC6376}}, using the relaxed header canonicalization rules specified in
that document but with a strict ordering component for the header fields 
covered by the cryptographic signature: 

1. The ARC sets MUST be ordered in descending instance (i=) order. 
2. The referenced ARC-Message-Signatures (matching i= value)
MUST immediately follow the ARC-Seal instance which included the reference.
3. The associated ARC-Authentication-Results header field (matching i= value) MUST be the 
last item in the list for each set of ARC header fields.

Thus, when prefixing ARC header fields to the existing header,

1. the AAR header would be prefixed first; then 
2. the AMS would be calculated and prefixed (above the AAR); 
3. lastly the AS would be calculated and prefixed (above the AMS).

The ARC-Message-Signature field(s) MUST not include any of the ARC-Seal
header field(s) (from prior ARC sets) in their signing scope in order 
maintain a separation of responsibilities.  When adding an 
ARC-Authentication-Results header field, it
MUST be added before computing the ARC-Message-Signature. When "sealing" the
message, an operator MUST create and attach the ARC-Message-Signature before
the ARC-Seal in order to reference it and embed the ARC-Message-Signature
within the ARC-Seal signature scope.  

Each ARC-Seal is connected to its respective ARC-Message-Signature and
ARC-Authentication-Results through the common value of the "i=" tag. 

### Handling Minor Violations in the ARC Sets

When ordering the ARC header field sets, misordering of header fields MUST be 
resolved as follows: 

* Within each set, header fields are sorted as specified in {{build-hdrs}}; then

* Any remaining order dependencies between sets (e.g., such as different 
hash algorithms) MUST be ordered as follows:

1. (First) By descending order of i=; then
2. (Second) By descending order of t= (from the ARC-Seal header field within the set); then
3. (Finally) By ascending US-ASCII {{RFC1345}} sort order for the entire canonicalized 
  header field set

The intent of specifying this ordering is to allow downstream message handlers to
add their own ARC sets in a deterministic manner and to provide some
resiliance against downstream MTAs which may reorder header fields. 

### Handling Major Violations in the ARC Sets

Gross violations of the ARC protocol definition (e.g., such as duplicated instance numbers 
or missing header fields or header field sets) MUST be terminated by the detecting
system setting 'cv=fail' in the ARC-Seal header. The status of the ARC evaluation 
reported in the corresponding AAR header field MUST be 'unknown'.

Because the violations can not be readily enumerated, the header fields signed by the AS header
field in the case of a major violation MUST be only the matching 'i=' instance headers 
created by the MTA which detected the malformed chain, as if this newest ARC set was the only
set present.

Downstream MTAs SHOULD NOT attempt any analysis on an ARC chain that has been marked 'fail'.

## Key Management and Binding

The public keys for ARC header fields follow the same requirements and semantics as those for
DKIM-Signatures, described in Section 3.6 of {{RFC6376}}. Operators may use
distinct selectors for the ARC header fields at their own discretion.

### Namespace

All ARC-related keys are stored in the same namespace as DKIM keys {{RFC6376}}: 
"_domainkey" specifically by adding the "._domainkey" suffix to the name of the
key (the "selector").  For example, given an ARC-Seal (or ARC-Message-Signature)
field of a "d=" tag value of "example.com" and an "s=" value of "foo.bar", the
DNS query seeking the public key will a query at the name
"foo.bar._domainkey.example.com". 

## Supporting Alternate Signing Algorithms

In the following branch diagrams, each algorithm is represented by an 'A' or 'B'
at each hop to depict the ARC chain that develops over a five hop scenario. 'x' 
represents a hop that does not support that algorithm.

### Introductory Period

Intermediaries MUST be able to validate ARC chains build with either algorithm
but MAY create ARC sets with either (or both) algorithm.

The introductory period should be at least six (6) months.

### Co-Existence Period

Intermediaries MUST be able to validate ARC chains build with either algorithm
and MUST create ARC sets with both algorithms.
Chains ending with either algorithm may be used for the result.

### Deprecation Period

ARC sets built with algorithms that are being deprecated MAY be considered valid
within an ARC chain, however, intermediaries MUST not create additional sets 
with the deprecated algorithm.

The deprecation period should be at least two (2) years.

### Obsolescence Period

ARC sets which are created with obsolete algorithms must be ignored.

# Usage

For a more thorough treatment of the recommended usage of the ARC header fields for 
both intermediaries and end receivers, please consult {{ARC-USAGE}}.

## Participation

The inclusion of additional ARC sets is to be done whenever a trust
boundary is crossed, and especially when prior DKIM-Signatures might not survive
the handling being performed such as some mailing lists that modify
the content of messages or some gateway transformations. Note that trust boundaries
might or might not exactly correspond with ADMD boundaries. Some organizations
may have internal trust boundaries within a single ADMD or have trust boundaries
which span more than one ADMD.

Each participating ADMD MUST validate the preceding ARC set as a
part of asserting their own seal. Until the chain is determined to be failed,
and marked with an ARC set bearing the "cv=fail" indication,
each participating ADMD SHOULD apply their own seal.

## Relationship between DKIM Signatures and ARC Headers

ARC-aware DKIM signers do not DKIM-sign any ARC header fields.

## Validating the ARC Set of Header Fields {#arc-validation}

Determining the validity of a chain of ARC sets is defined above in {{cv-calc}}.
Validation failures MUST be indicated with a "cv=" tag value of 'fail' 
when attaching a subsequent ARC-Seal header field.

## ARC Set Validity

### Assessing Chain Validity Violations

There are a wide variety of ways in which the ARC set of header fields can be broken.
Receivers need to be wary of ascribing motive to such breakage although patterns
of common behaviour may provide some basis for adjusting local policy decisions.

This specification is exclusively focused on well-behaved, participating intermediaries
that result in a valid chain of ARC-related header fields. The value of such a well-formed,
valid chain needs to be interpreted with care since malicious content can be 
easily introduced by otherwise well-intended senders through machine or account
compromises. All normal content-based analysis still needs to be performed on any
messages bearing a valid chain of ARC header sets.

### Responding to ARC Validity Violations

If a receiver determines that the ARC chain has failed, the
receiver MAY signal the breakage through the extended SMTP response code 5.7.7 {{RFC3463}} 
"message integrity failure" {{ENHANCED-STATUS}} and corresponding SMTP response code.

### Recording the Results of ARC Evaluation

Receivers MAY add an "arc=pass" or "arc=fail" method annotation into a locally-affixed
Authentication-Results {{RFC7601}} header field.

### Output Data Points from ARC Evaluation

The evaluation of a series of ARC sets results in the following data which MAY be
used to inform local-policy decisions:

* A list of the "d=" domains found in the validated (all) ARC-Seal header fields;
* The "d=" domain found in the most recent (highest instance number) AMS header field
  (since that is the only one necessarily validated)

### Reporting ARC Effects for DMARC Local Policy - Interim

\[\[ Discussion on the IETF DMARC-WG list has indicated some interest in more substantial
reporting for analytic purposes. To support that effort, the following guidance is 
provided only as an interim, minimal data set. A more complete reporting construct
will be specified in a related spec - TBD. ]]

Receivers SHOULD indicate situations in which ARC evaluation influenced the
results of their local policy determination. DMARC reporting of ARC-informed decisions
is augmented by adding a local_policy comment explanation as follows: 

~~~~~~~~~~
&lt;policy_evaluated>
  &lt;disposition>delivered&lt;/disposition>
  &lt;dkim>fail&lt;/dkim>
  &lt;spf>fail&lt;/spf>
  &lt;reason>
   &lt;type>local_policy&lt;/type>
   &lt;comment>arc=pass ams=d1.example d=d1.example,d2.example&lt;/comment>
  &lt;/reason>
&lt;/policy_evaluated>
~~~~~~~~~~

# Privacy Considerations

The ARC-Seal chain provides a verifiable record of the handlers for a message.
Anonymous remailers will probably not find this to match their operating goals.

# IANA Considerations

This specification adds three new header fields as defined below.

## Authentication-Results Method Registry Update 

This draft adds one item to the IANA "Email Authentication Methods" registry:

* Method : arc

  Defined: {{&SELF}}

  ptype: header

  Property: chain evaluation result

  Value: chain evaluation result status (see {{seal-hdr}})

and is based on a proposal described in {{RFC6982}}.  The description of
implementations in this section is intended to assist the IETF in its decision
processes in progressing drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any
individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.
Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information presented here
that was supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their features.
Readers are advised to note that other implementations may exist.

According to {{RFC6982}}, "this will allow reviewers and working groups to
assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of running code,
which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation and feedback that have
made the implemented protocols more mature.  It is up to the individual working
groups to use this information as they see fit".

This information is known to be correct as of the third interoperability 
test event which was held on 2016-06-17.

## GMail test reflector and incoming validation

  Organization: Google

  Description: Internal prototype implementation with both debug
    analysis and validating + sealing pass-through function

  Status of Operation: Production - Incoming Validation

  Coverage: Full spec implemented as of {{ARC-DRAFT}}

  Licensing: Proprietary - Internal only

  Implementation Notes: Full functionality was demonstrated during
   the interop testing on 2016-06-17

  In place for reporting usage only as of 2016-11-21 on all GMail flows.

  Rechecked general incoming validation as of 2017-02-24 interop event.

  Contact Info: <arc-discuss@dmarc.org>

## AOL test reflector and internal tagging

  Organization: AOL

  Description: Internal prototype implementation with both debug
    analysis and validating + sealing pass-through function

  Status of Operation: Beta

  Coverage: ARC chain validity status checking is not operational, but
    otherwise this system conforms to {{ARC-DRAFT}}

  Licensing: Proprietary - Internal only

  Implementation Notes: Full functionality with the exception of chain
   validity checking was demonstrated during the interop testing on 2016-06-17

  Available for production mail via selected account whitelisting for test
   validation only.

  Intermittent stability problems discovered at the interop event on 
   2017-02-24. Remediation underway as of the publication of this draft.

  Contact Info: <arc-discuss@dmarc.org>

## dkimpy 

   Organization: dkimpy developers

   Description: Python DKIM package

   Status of Operation: Production

   Coverage: The internal test suite is incomplete, but the command line
   developmental version of validator was demonstrated to interoperate with
   the Google and AOL implementations during the interop on 2016-06-17 and the
   released version passes the tests in {{ARC-TEST}}
   https://github.com/ValiMail/arc_test_suite with both python and python3.

   Licensing: Open/Other (same as dkimpy package)

   Contact Info: https://launchpad.net/dkimpy

## OpenARC

  Organization: TDP/Murray Kucherawy

  Description: Implemention of milter functionality related to the OpenDKIM
    and OpenDMARC packages

  Status of Operation: Beta

  Coverage: Built to support {{ARC-DRAFT}}

  Licensing: Open/Other (same as OpenDKIM and OpenDMARC packages)

  Implementation Notes: The build is FreeBSD oriented and takes some tweaks
    to build on RedHat-based Linux platforms. 

    Initial testing during the
    interop event on 2016-06-17 showed that it can be operational, but the
    documentation regarding configuration settings is unclear and the 
    generated signature values do not validate when compared to the Google,
    AOL or dkimpy implementations.

    Testing during the 2017-02-24 interop event showed that some of the 
    problems have been fixed, but there are still interoperability problems
    when trying to use OpenARC in a "sandwich" configuration around a MLM.

## Mailman addition

  Organization: Mailman development team

  Description: Integrated ARC capabilities within the Mailman package

  Status of Operation: Patch submitted 

  Coverage: Unknown

  Licensing: Same as mailman package - GPL

  Implementation Notes: Incomplete at this time

  Contact Info: [https://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/contact.html]

## Copernica/MailerQ web-based validation

  Organization: Copernica

  Description: Web-based validation of ARC-signed messages

  Status of Operation: Beta

  Coverage: Built to support {{ARC-DRAFT}}

  Licensing: On-line usage only, 

  Implementation Notes: Released 2016-10-24
  
   Requires full message content to be pasted into a web form found at
   [http://arc.mailerq.com/] (warning - https is not supported).

   An additional instance of an ARC signature can be added if one is 
    willing to paste a private key into an unsecured web form.

   Initial testing shows that results match the other implementations
    listed in this section.

# Security Considerations {#sec-con}

The Security Considerations of {{RFC6376}} and {{RFC7601}} apply directly to
this specification.

Inclusion of ARC sets in the header of emails may cause problems for some
older or more constrained MTAs if they are unable to accept the greater 
size of the header.

Operators who receive a message bearing N ARC sets has to complete N+1 
DNS queries to evaluate the chain (barring DNS redirection mechanisms which 
can increase the lookups for a given target value).  This has at least two effects:

  1. An attacker can send a message to an ARC partipant with a concocted
sequence of ARC sets bearing the domains of intended victims, and all of them
will be queried by the participant until a failure is discovered.

  2.  DKIM only does one DNS check per signature, while this one can do many.
Absent caching, slow DNS responses can cause SMTP timeouts; this could be
exploited as a DoS attack.

## Message Content Suspicion

Recipients are cautioned to treat messages bearing ARC sets with the
same suspicion that they apply to all other email messages. This includes
appropriate content scanning and other checks for potentially malicious
content. The handlers which are identified within the ARC-Seal chain may be
used to provide input to local policy engines in cases where the sending
system's DKIM-Signature does not validate.

#### Example 2, Step B: Message from list forwarded

The message is delivered to a mailbox at gmail.com  
Processing at gmail.com:

-   gmail.com performs usual authentication checks
-   gmail.com adds Auth-Results: and Received: header
-   Determines that message fails DMARC
-   Checks for ARC-Seal: header; finds one
-   Validates the signature in the ARC-Seal: header, which covers the ARC-Authentication-Results: header
-   Uses the ARC-Auth-Results: values, but:
-   Instead of delivering message, prepares to forward message per user settings
-   Applies usual DKIM signature
-   gmail.com adds it’s own ARC-Seal: header, contents of which are
    -       version
    -       sequence number (“i=2”)
    -       hash algorithm (SHA256 as example)
    -       timestamp (“t=”)
    -       selector for key (“s=notary01”)
    -       domain for key (“d=gmail.com”)
    -       headers included  in hash (“h=ARC-Authentication-Results:ARC-Seal”)
    -       Note: algorithm requires only ARC-Seals with lower sequence # be included, in ascending order
    -       signature of the header hash

Hey gang,
This is a test message.

### Example 2: Message received by Recipient

Let’s say that the Recipient is example.com  
Processing at example.com:

-       example.com performs usual authentication checks
-       example.com adds Auth-Results: header, Received header
-       Determines that message fails DMARC
-       Checks for ARC-Seal: header; finds two
-       Validates the signature in the highest numbered (“i=2”) ARC-Seal: header, which covers all previous ARC-Seal: and ARC-Authentication-Results: headers
-       Validates the other ARC-Seal header (“i=1”), which covers the ARC-Authentication-Results: header
-       example.com uses the ARC-Authentication-Results: values

Here’s what the message looks like at this point:

### Message is then received at example.org

 

#### Example 3, Step A: Message forwarded to list members with source

Processing at example.org:

-   example.org performs authentication checks
-   example.org applies standard DKIM signature
-   Checks for ARC-Seal: header; finds one (i=1)
-   Validates the signature in the ARC-Seal (i=1): header, which covers the d1.example ARC-Message-Signature: header
-   example.org adds ARC-Auth-Results header
-   example.org adds usual Received: header
-   example.org adds a DKIM-Signature
-   example.org adds a ARC-Seal header, contents of which are
    -       sequence number (“i=2”)
    -       hash algorithm (SHA256 as example)
    -       timestamp (“t=”)
    -       chain validity ("cv=")
    -       selector for key (“s=seal2015”)
    -       domain for key (“d=example.org”)
    -       signature ("b=")

#### Example 3, Step B: Message from list forwarded with source

The message is delivered to a mailbox at gmail.com  
Processing at gmail.com:

-   gmail.com performs usual authentication checks
-   gmail.com adds Auth-Results: and Received: header
-   Determines that message fails DMARC
-   Checks for ARC-Seal: header; finds two
-   Validates the signature in the ARC-Seal (i=2): header, which covers the ARC-Authentication-Results: header
-   Validates the signature in the ARC-Seal (i=1): header, which covers the d1.example ARC-Message-Signature: header
-   Uses the ARC-Auth-Results: values, but:
-   Instead of delivering message, prepares to forward message per user settings
-   Applies usual DKIM signature
-   gmail.com adds it’s own ARC-Seal: header, contents of which are
    -       version
    -       sequence number (“i=2”)
    -       hash algorithm (SHA256 as example)
    -       timestamp (“t=”)
    -       selector for key (“s=notary01”)
    -       domain for key (“d=gmail.com”)
    -       Note: algorithm requires only ARC-Seals with lower sequence # be included, in ascending order
    -       signature of the chain

Here’s what the message looks like at this point:

Hey gang,
This is a test message.

### Example 3: Message received by Recipient

Let’s say that the Recipient is example.com  
Processing at example.com:

-       example.com performs usual authentication checks
-       example.com adds Auth-Results: header, Received header
-       Determines that message fails DMARC
-       Checks for ARC-Seal: header; finds three
-       Validates the signature in the highest numbered (“i=2”) ARC-Seal: header, which covers all previous ARC-Seal: and ARC-Authentication-Results: headers
-       Validates the other ARC-Seal header (“i=2”), which covers the ARC-Authentication-Results: header
-       Validates the other ARC-Seal header (“i=1”), which covers the d1.example ARC-Message-Signature: header
-       example.com uses the ARC-Authentication-Results: values

Here’s what the message looks like at this point:
